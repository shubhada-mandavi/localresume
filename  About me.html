  <p > <strong> My Story </strong>
    <br />
    <br />Trust me, I wish to let you a step closer to me in the fanciest possible way, but my life has been a mess all around.
    <br />So, keeping it real, I would write this as a true reflection of my life.
    <br />21 orbits around the Sun have taught me one thing: Life never unfolds the way you want it to.
    <br />
    <br />I was an above-average student who loved History and Archaeology, but then I dropped two years to prepare for Med School entrance test.
    <br /> Life took another sharp turn and, I found myself at an engineering college battling complex mathematics.
    <br />
    <br />Sometimes I scribble stories or dribble basketball or croak in the shower. (Mostly, I talk to the stars).
    <br /> And oh, I like talking to people! (but only if they match my vibe). But this wasnâ€™t always the case.
    <br /> I grew up hating myself,
    criticizing, despising, and ridiculing myself. I put myself through intense trauma, and life just added its bit to it.
    <br /> This blog is where I wish to laugh, cry, share my life, and heal.
    <br />
    <br />Being the talkative person I am, I would love to blabber all of it together, but I will save the rest for another time.
